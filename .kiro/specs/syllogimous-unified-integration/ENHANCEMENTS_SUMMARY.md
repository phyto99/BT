## 🔬 Needs Research (Not in Spec Yet)

These features require validation before implementation:

### Interactive 3D Visualizations (Post-Answer)
**Status:** 🔬 Research needed  
**Location:** `.kiro/specs/syllogimous-unified-integration/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

**Questions to answer:**
- Does 3D interaction improve learning vs static 2D?
- Do users engage with post-answer explanations?
- Is implementation effort justified by benefit?

**Next steps:** A/B test static vs interactive explanations

### Real-Time Strategy Hints
**Status:** 🔬 Research needed  
**Location:** `.kiro/specs/syllogimous-unified-integration/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

**Questions to answer:**
- Do hints improve learning or create dependency?
- What's optimal hint timing?
- Does hint availability reduce cognitive training effect?

**Next steps:** Literature review + user survey

### Dynamic Premise Generation
**Status:** 🔬 Research needed  
**Location:** `.kiro/specs/syllogimous-unified-integration/FUTURE_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

**Questions to answer:**
- Does dynamic adjustment improve vs fixed progression?
- Can we accurately estimate working memory capacity?
- Is this better than existing auto-progression?

**Next steps:** Prototype + A/B test

## 🌐 Deferred to Unified System

These features should be implemented system-wide, not just for Syllogimous:

### 1. AI-Powered Difficulty Adaptation
**Status:** 🌐 Unified system spec  
**Location:** `.kiro/specs/FUTURE_UNIFIED_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

**Why unified:** All games benefit from understanding overall cognitive state

### 2. Competitive & Collaborative Multiplayer
**Status:** 🌐 Unified system spec  
**Location:** `.kiro/specs/FUTURE_UNIFIED_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

**Why unified:** Infrastructure (WebRTC, leaderboards) should be shared

### 3. Comprehensive Accessibility
**Status:** 🌐 Unified system spec  
**Location:** `.kiro/specs/FUTURE_UNIFIED_ENHANCEMENTS.md`

**Why unified:** Accessibility should be consistent across all games
